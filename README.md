# Roller Coaster Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes data related to roller coasters using Python. The notebook covers essential steps of exploratory data analysis (EDA), from importing libraries to understanding and preparing the dataset for analysis.

## Key Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**: Essential Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are used.
2. **Reading the Data**: Data is imported from a CSV file (`coaster_db.csv`).
3. **Data Understanding**: Insights into the structure, shape, and content of the dataset.
4. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure consistency and usability.
5. **Feature Understanding**: Analyzing key features and attributes of roller coasters.

## Features and Insights

- **Data Preparation**: Handles missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Understanding**: Analyzes relationships between key attributes like height, speed, and inversions.
- **Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create insightful visualizations.

## Usage

To run this notebook:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Ensure the dataset (`coaster_db.csv`) is in the project directory.
4. Open and run the notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
